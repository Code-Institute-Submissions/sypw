# Sort Your Paperwork (SYPW)
## Milestone Project 4 by Stan Kaczorkiewicz

The main idea behind this project is the conversation I once had with my
fiancee, where we've been wondering how much paper her employer wastes for
payslips, that they send to all 80 000 emploees every week.
I know that there is many similar apps, my last company was useing one of them,
but it looks like there is a need for more, so why not to make one.

My main assumption is to make it as simple as it's possible, in order to work.


# UX

I want this app to be ineractive, intuitive, responsive and user-friendly.


To beautify my code I used [that program](https://codebeautify.org/)

# Credit

While making this project I was inspired by the ButiqueAdo app, which is Django project of the Code Institute, that I accomplished few weeks ago.

The idea for this form of comunication between users comes from [here](https://data-flair.training/blogs/discussion-forum-python-django/)

<!-- Calendar as for 13/10/2020 comes from [this](https://codepen.io/hind-jai/full/GaxmYP) free library of bootstrap projects and has been found [here](https://colorlib.com/wp/bootstrap-calendars/) -->

As the previous one turns out to be not working, I'm going to try [this](https://year-calendar.github.io/js-year-calendar/examples) and I'm writing this to remember the link later on
