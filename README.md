## Milestone Project 4 by Stan Kaczorkiewicz

The main idea behind this project is the conversation I once had with my
fiancee, where we've been wondering how much paper her employer wastes for
payslips, that they send to all 80 000 emploees every week.
I know that there is many similar apps, my last company was useing one of them,
but it looks like there is a need for more, so why not to make one.

My main assumption is to make it as simple as it's possible, in order to work.


# UX

I want this app to be ineractive, intuitive, responsive and user-friendly.


To beautify my code I used: https://codebeautify.org/

# Credit

While making this project I was inspired by the ButiqueAdo app, which is Django project of the Code Institute, that I accomplished few weeks ago.
